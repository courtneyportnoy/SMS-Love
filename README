This is a work in progress for my Data Representation class with Jer Thorpe at NYU's ITP program. The data I am visualizing is over 12000 SMS messages sent between myself and my partner between August 2010 and March 2012. The form of the final project is still TBD, but I am hoping to represent the number of times we express "love", either through words or through emoticon symbols. This code just gets the data from an external CSV file, saves the messages, and draws a heart image to the screen for every time the word "love" or the word "[Heart]" appears. "[Heart]" represents a regular heart emoticon. There are about 10 different emoticons that will eventually be a part of the project.
